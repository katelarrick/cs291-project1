  <h1>Textile Art</h1>

  <div class="text">
    <p>I first learned how to crochet when I was nine years old, and I learned how to sew on a sewing machine shortly afterwards. I then began to sell the items that I made to family and friends while adding embroidery and knitting to my repertoire. I have had many hours of practice with these skills, so I think that I can call myself an expert! Below is a table of textile art FAQ.
